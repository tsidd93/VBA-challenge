Module 2 UofT Bootcamp Assignment

Code became a little haphazard since only a little while ago I had closed the excel file I did all the work on and realized when I reopened it that the module had been erased.

I've quickly put it back together again, but it may not be as efficient as it was when I wrote it the first time and there may be a few extra unneeded variables instantiated. 


---UPDATE---

Sorry for the incorrect upload last time. I was not aware of the correct way to upload a VBA file - I thought uploaded the .xlsm was enough.

I've added the .BAS as well as a .vbs to be safe.

I've also added the screenshots of all the results.
